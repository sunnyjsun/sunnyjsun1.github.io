I am 6 foot 2 inches tall and played the small foward position for my high school varsity team. I am currently on 2 IM basketball teams at Cal.<p> I play fantasy basketball, basketball video games (NBA 2k8 to 2k16), nerf hoop basketball, and of course, actual basketball! You can watch my first dunk right below!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyMQEmYLM_Q" target="_blank"><div id="link" >My First College Dunk</div></a>
	<br><br><h1>Cinema</h1>Need a partner to go watch a movie with? I'm your guy!<p>I am a movie fanatic and have watched well over a 1000 films in my life. I never mind watching movies again and there's no genre I would not watch. I'm always guled to the <b>Rotten Tomato</b> page and love watching the Oscars, Golden Globe, and Sundance Film Festival.<p> <b>Mary + Max</b> and the <b>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</b> are two of my favorite films.<br><br><br><br><br> <h1>Golf</h1>I've been playing golf on an organize level since I was 15 and was my high school golf captain. My handicap is a +4 on average though if I'm really feeling it, I have some days where I'm a scratch golfer. <p><br>My favorite golfer is Rickie Fowler and my equipment mainly consists of: a Scotty Cameron Putter, TaylorMade RocketBlade Wedge, TaylorMade Burner 2.0 Irons, R11 Driver, and a Nike Vapor Flex Woods
